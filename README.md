This project is built on the [Spotify API](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/), and the initial function is to serve as an on-demand look at my recent top tracks. It was inspired by the "2017 Wrapped" end-of-year thing, and the API allows you to recreate that experience at any time! It also serves as my first real project in javascript, as I'm learning React.

## Setup
The setup should be as simple as: 
```bash
git clone <this_repo>
cd spotify-viewer/
npm install
npm start
```

Then open on http://localhost:3000/


## Future Improvements
Over the next days and weeks, expect the following features:

- Ability to see your own top artists & tracks after logging in (currently hard-coded to my data)
- Select timeline for past 1 month, past 4 months, & all-time top tracks
- REFACTORED CODE!!!! currently just trying to get something up. it will adhere to better practices soon
- An intuitive, informative UI that gives the feel of the Spotify platform
- Hosting on AWS
- [Stretch feature] A quiz game where you can test your friends' knowledge of your most-listened artists
